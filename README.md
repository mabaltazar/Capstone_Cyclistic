- Planning Document  
These outline the business goals, KPIs, timeline, and scope for the analysis.

üß™ Part 2: Data Exploration with BigQuery
- Queried and cleaned raw rider datasets using SQL in BigQuery
- Explored key business questions around ride trends, member types, and seasonal behavior
- Created two target tables: a table that capture the entire year and a table that focuses on summer trends

üìä Part 3: Data Visualization with Tableau
- Built an interactive Tableau dashboard highlighting insights on rider behavior, usage patterns, and seasonal trends
- Compared casual vs. member riders to inform marketing and retention strategies
