# 🚲 Cyclistic Business Intelligence Capstone Project  
Welcome to my end-of-course project for the Google Business Intelligence Certificate. This project simulates a real-world BI engagement for Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in New York. It showcases the complete workflow from requirements gathering to insights and data visualization.

📌 Project Overview
- Objective: Analyze rider behavior and uncover insights to support Cyclistic’s marketing and customer success strategies.
- Tools Used: BigQuery, Tableau, SQL, Excel, Google Docs
- Deliverables: BI documentation, SQL-based data exploration, and interactive data visualization

🧾 Part 1: Business Documentation
Created three key documents based on internal meeting notes:
- Stakeholder Requirements Document
- Project Requirements Document
- Planning Document  
These outline the business goals, KPIs, timeline, and scope for the analysis.

🧪 Part 2: Data Exploration with BigQuery
- Queried and cleaned raw rider datasets using SQL in BigQuery
- Explored key business questions around ride trends, member types, and seasonal behavior
- Created two target tables: a table that capture the entire year and a table that focuses on summer trends

📊 Part 3: Data Visualization with Tableau
- Built an interactive Tableau dashboard highlighting insights on rider behavior, usage patterns, and seasonal trends
- Compared casual vs. member riders to inform marketing and retention strategies

🔍 Key Insights
- Casual riders spike in summer months, while member usage remains consistent
- Members take longer but more frequent rides, suggesting potential upsell opportunities
- Visual segmentation revealed neighborhoods with strong growth potential
